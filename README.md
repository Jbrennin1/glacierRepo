The Related Items & Your Outfits module will display two sets of Carousels with cards about the product. The first set, 'Related Items', will be a list of products determined internally, that are related to the product currently being shown in the overview.

## Usage

The primary goal of this repository was to provide an educational platform for our team of developers to practice building a React application utilizing a microservice architecture. The project involved collaborative work between three other engineers to ensure a robust and well-designed application. By working on this project, we gained valuable experience in developing and deploying microservices in a real-world application using git workflow.
